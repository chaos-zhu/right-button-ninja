# Right Ninja Minimal Windows 10 Virtual Desktop Gesture

Right-Button-Ninja is a mouse gesture software that adapts to the Windows 10 platform. This software is written in AutoHotKey and realizes a highly simulated touchpad by identifying mouse gestures in four directions, helping users to manage the desktop more conveniently and quickly .

You no longer need a keyboard to use the virtual desktop. Just hold down the right mouse button and swipe, and you can experience it.


## Demo

** Gesture usage: Start from any position, press and hold the right mouse button, then slide the mouse neatly, release the right button immediately. **
